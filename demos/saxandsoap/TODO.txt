Various items remaining here:

- the sax-basics file still has some unused stuff

- the CDATA handling in the sax api is not tested
[Also, the underlying CL-XML does not pass data in reasonable chunks
yet].  Not an issue for SOAP.

- There is no SOAP 'writer' yet.

- I've not yet verified this with many soap files. 
The true test will be interoperation with Apache soap
and that requires an HTTP 1.1 server

- Numerous bits of SOAP are not implemented:
TYPES:
arrayCoordinate
arrays with offset
decimal type
times [there are several kinds: time, date etc, duration, instances]
uri reference
binary
long
short
byte
unsigned-x types

PROTOCOL:
ID, IDREF, Entity, Notation,

The envelope and body should have distinct classes
so the headers can be properly handled [or generated]

There needs to be a 'fault' class

Various bits in the Apache Java API's would make sense to be copied
in some fashion

There is no support for UTF-8, just ISO-8859-1 right now
[this may be fixable in the lower level xml parser]
