<h2>SAX api</h2>

This directory has the SAX api for lisp parsing of XML files.

<p>The majority of the code here written by Stanley Knutson
(knewt@alum.mit.edu)

<p>Some of code in sax-basics came from <a
href="http://wilbur-rdf.sourceforge.net/">Wilbur-RDF project</a>
However, it has been modified significantly to use the underlying
CL-XML parser from <a href="http://www.cl-xml.org">cl-xml.org</a>

<p>This is a "work in progress" since there is not yet any tools for
writing SOAP.

<p>The top-level function is sax:soap-xml-parse.
