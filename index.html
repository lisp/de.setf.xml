Common Lisp support for the 'Extensible Markup Language'</H2>
<P><A HREF="mailto:James.Anderson@setf.de">james anderson</A>,

</P>
<P>CL-XML is a collection of Common LISP modules for data stream parsing and serialization
according to the &quot;Extensible Markup Language&quot; and anscilliary standards.
The modules perform parsing and serialization between XML, XML Query, and XML Path
expressions and DOM-compatible CLOS instances. The XML processor includes a conformant,
validating, namespace-aware model-based parser. It supports, in particular, namespace-aware
DTD-based validation. The XPATH module comprises LISP bindings for the XML Path library,
an S-expression-based namespace-aware path model, and a macro-based path model compiler
which implements an XPATH-algebra. The XQUERY module comprises LISP bindings for
the XML Query library, an S-expression-based query model which incorporates the XPATH
facilities, and a macro-based query compiler. The base CLOS model implements the
XML Query Data Model in a class hierarchy which presents an Infoset compatible programming
interface.</P>
<P>A description is available <A HREF="documentation/index.html">here</A>.</P>
<P>Look <A HREF="documentation/howto/index.html">here</A> for some hints on how to load cl-xml,
work with XML documents, and even implement simple rpc.</P>

<H3>Availability</H3>
<H4>In-Progress</H4>
<P>20040101: There has been some progress on method combinationd for clisp, which
means thatI'm now a step closer to porting to that implementation. For information
on porting to other common-lisp environments <A HREF="documentation/cl-xml.html#porting">here</A>
is a list of known issues.</P>
<H4>Releases</H4>
<P>Source archives are available for the MCL, Lispworks, Allegro, CMUCL, OpenMCL,
and Scieneer implementations of Common Lisp. A separate <A HREF="documentation/releases.html">document</A>
provides the download paths and details on the implementation status.</P>
<H4></H4>
<H4>BNF</H4>
<P>The respective BNF descriptions of the respective <A HREF="bnf/xml-grammar.bnf">XML</A>,
<A HREF="bnf/xpath-grammar.bnf">XPath</A>, and <A HREF="bnf/xql-grammar.bnf">XQuery</A>
syntax used to generate the parsers are available individually. In some cases, they
have been normalized and otherwise edited to expedite parsing. I'd be interested
to hear if any of the modifications would appear to affect conformance.</P>
<P>An additional BNF is included for <A HREF="bnf/html-grammar.bnf">HTML</A>. This
includes additional productions for unterminated empty tags. (see <A HREF="code/xparser/html-parser.lisp">xml:code;xparser;html-parser.lisp</A>)</P>

	<DT><B>graphs</B></DT>
	<DD>I was curious about how an automatic layout package would fare with DTD and DOM
	graphs. A <A HREF="Graphs/xqdm-graph.lisp">naive generator</A> for <A HREF="http://www.graphviz.org/">GraphViz</A>'s
	&quot;dot&quot; format is a straight-forward graph walk. The <A HREF="Graphs/test-xqdm-graph.lisp">results</A>
	are adequate for smaller examples, but larger instances will need a more refined
	approach. The larger files failed to load with the current GraphViz 1.7.6 beta for
	Windows. As I'm rather Linux/C imparied, I was fortunate and grateful, that someone
	was curious and ran them through the Linux version. Thus the two SVGs below, which
	I was able to view with Adobe's <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/svg/
  anyzone:ID    CDATA  #IMPLIED">SVG</A>
	plugin.
