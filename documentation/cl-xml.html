The XML processor includes a <A HREF="XMLConform">conformant</A>,validating, <A HREF="#W3C.XMLNames">namespace-aware</A> model-based parser. It supports,in particular, namespace-aware DTD-based validation. The XPATH module comprises LISPbindings for the XML Path library, an S-expression-based namespace-aware path model,and a macro-based path model compiler which implements an XPATH-algebra. The XQUERYmodule comprises LISP bindings for the XML Query library, an S-expression-based querymodel which incorporates the XPATH facilities, and a macro-based query compiler.The base CLOS model class library implements the <A HREF="W3C.XQDM">XML Query DataModel</A> and presents an <A HREF="#W3C.XMLINFO">Infoset compatiable</A> programminginterface.</P><P>This document describes the implemented <A HREF="PARSE-PROCESS">parsing/processing</A>mechanism for CLOS-based applications, and explains how to use the processor. Theprocessor is intended for use both as a stand-alone XML interface and as an extensionto the CL-HTTP server. The runtime environment is examined during compilation todetermine if the if HTTP support is already present. If so, then the existing facilitiesare used and server extensions are generated to support XML. If CL-HTTP is not present,then these extensions are not generated and only file streams and primitive httpstreams are supported.</P><P>A cursory introduction to XML is available <A HREF="xmlIntro.html">here</A>. Sourcearchives are available for the MCL, Lispworks, Allegro, CMUCL, OpenMCL, and Scieneerimplementations of Common Lisp. A separate <A HREF="releases.html">document</A> providesthe download paths and details on the implementation status.<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD><HR>		</TD>		<TD WIDTH="24" UNITS="PIXELS">[<A HREF="#TOP">Top</A>]</TD>	</TR></TABLE><H3><A NAME="ImplementationLevel"></A> Implementation Level</H3><H3></H3><UL>	<LI>The <A HREF="#ModuleXML">XML</A> (0.949) module implements a conformant, namespace-aware,	validating XML processor which instantitiates an Info-Model compatible document model.	It also supports event-based parsing according to both a grammar-based and a SAX-equivalent	event interface.	<LI>The <A HREF="#ModuleXMLPath">XPath</A> (0.503) module processes XML path expressions	to generate automata which may be combined with a document, or a document fragmemt	to generate the referenced nodes.	<LI>The <A HREF="#ModuleXMLQuery">XQuery</A> (0.503) module processes XML Query expressions	to generate automata which may be combined with a document, or an element, to generate	the denoted projection.<BR>	The parser succeeds for the 20010608 use cases. Testing is proceeding for the processing.	<LI>The <A HREF="#ModuleXMLQueryDataModel">XMLQueryDataModel</A> (0.913) module provides	a programming interface to generate and manipulate document models.</UL><P>The respective releases have been tested with</P><UL>	<LI>ALLEGRO(5.0.1)	<LI>cmucl (18e+ experimental-MOP/PCL)	<LI>LispWorks(4)	<LI>MCL(5.0b)	<LI>openmcl (0.13.3)</UL><P><H4><A NAME="ModuleXML"></A>XML</H4><P>The XML module implements a conformant, <A HREF="#W3C.XMLNames">namespace-aware</A>,validating <A HREF="#W3C.XML">XML</A> processor which instantitiates an Info-Modelcompatible document model. It also supports event-based parsing according to botha grammar-based and a SAX-equivalent event interface.</P><P>The processor always incorporates external references. A referenced document definitionis instantiated and incorporated in the document instance as an internal documenttype definition model. The definition is used to effect instance defaulting and typingand to perform in-line document validation. The parser can be invoked with validationenabled or disabled.<BR>It can be invoked so as to produce a data instance, a parse tree, or to produce aparse event stream. Among these varaitions it is possible to parse without generatingany result. By default it parses the production designated as <CODE>Document</CODE>in the standard and generates a document node, but it can also be invoked so as toparse others of the non-terminal forms, subject to the constraints implicit in thecontext-sensitivity of XML lexical analysis. (see <A HREF="../code/xparser/xml-tokenizer.lisp">xml-tokenizer</A>.)</P><P>Namespace-aware qualified name resolution is effected as an integral aspect ofparsing. Name resolution within the document element accords with XML-1.0+Names.Name resolution within a DTD applies analogous rules to element and attribute declarations.As a consequence, namespace-aware dtd-based validation is supported.</P><H5>Conformance</H5><P>The processor passes 1749 of the 1812 tests in the <A HREF="#XMLConform">OASIS</A>conformance suite when the base implementation supports sixteen-bit characters. Thetest protocol is present in the release in the file &quot;xml:tests;test-oasis-xxxxxxxx.txt&quot;.This protocol file notes the discrepancies, which fall into three categories<UL>	<LI>PE: presumed errors in the conformance suite	<UL>		<LI>The processor requires namespace conformance. Several of the test documents would		appear to include names which do not conform to the namespace recommendation.		<LI>Several documents includes references to non-existent external entities.		<LI>Several tests appear to concern entity expansion where the entity replacement		text comprises a single markup character. I have taken the remark in the recommendation		(The string &quot;AT&amp;amp;T;&quot; expands to &quot;AT&amp;T;&quot; and the remaining		ampersand is not recognized as an entity-reference delimiter.) to mean that it is		conformant to treat single-character value entities as literal character text.	</UL>	<LI>IR: implementation restrictions:	<UL>		<LI>character data is restricted to codes less than 2**16 in MCL, LispWorks and the		Allegro 5.0.1 international version. The Allegro ascii version restricts codes to		2**8, which entails additional non-conformant cases.	</UL>	<LI>VR: validation restrictions: Certain of the validity constraints entail as much	processing as simply rectifying the &quot;error&quot;. Others would entail deferred	validity checks.	<UL>		<LI>ID-validity constraints are not enforced. A second pass over the references would		be necessary to enforce this constraint.		<LI>Notation names must be defined prior to appearance. In this sense they are handled		the same as entity references.		<LI>The validity constraint on the standalone value is not enforced. In order to		detect the violations where 'yes' is specified, the processor must act as if the		value were 'no'. At the point where an &quot;error&quot; would be detected, the processor		simply continues to behave as if the declaration were 'yes', which has the consequence		that, but for the standalone value, a valid document is generated. In a similar sense,		the standalone value 'no' does not preclude validitiy errors for undefined entities.		<LI>Parameter entity nesting is not enforced. Where the replacement text encodes		a wellformed content model, no error is reported.	</UL></UL><P>Numerous test documents include invalid URI literals and/or system identifierswhich were apparently not intended to be interpreted in a platform independent manner.In such cases, when configured for CL-HTTP, warnings will appear.</P><P>The validation engine is insensitive to nondeterministic models.</P><P>The validation engine is insensitive to lexical encoding - in particular to entities,to processing instructions and to comments. Which means that it is insensitive todistinctions such as those suggested in <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V10-2e-errata">xml-V10-2e-errata</A>#E15.Should this matter to users, a mode could be added to enforce this behaviour. Atthis point it seems senseless to distinguish validity based on properties which themodels do not express.</P><H5>Validation</H5><P>Where the parser is invoked with validation enabled, the respetive elements areexamined at the conclusion of the respective content. It is also possible to effectstatic validation for elements at will. Where validation is performed, content modelsare compiled as referenced. The models can be read from a DTD or constructed programmatically.</P><P>The validation mechanism is namespace-aware. This as a direct consequence of theparser's ability to interpret and propagate namespace bindings within the DTD.</P><H5>Serialization</H5><P>Methods are available for namespace aware serialization. They take three forms.</P><UL>	<LI><A HREF="../code/xparser/xml-writer.lisp">xml-writer</A> provides a macro for	direct encoding to a stream	<LI><A HREF="../code/xparser/xml-printer.lisp">xml-printer</A> provides methods for	serializing instance documents and components	<LI><A HREF="../code/xclos/xclos-serialize.lisp">xclos-serialize</A> provides methods	for serializing arbitrary clos instances either according to meta-object data or	according to a document definition.

The environment features <B><CODE>xml-symbols</CODE></B> and <B><CODE>nameset-tokenizers</CODE></B>in the file <B><CODE>xml:base;parameters.lisp</CODE></B> determine the name implementation.</P><P>As of 0.918, the instance/symbol implementations have been tests in MCL, LispWorksand Allegro.</P><P><H4><A NAME="XMLPathModule"></A>XMLPath</H4><P>The XMLPath module implements access to document models based on XML Path expressions.It includes an implementation for the XML Path library, an interpreter for pathsformulated as S-expressions and, a parser to translate string-encoded expressionsinto the equivalent S-expression form.</P><H5>Conformance</H5><P>The path parser manages all of the examples in the XML Path recommendation. I'm,unfortunately, at a loss for a conformance suite. I'm waiting for a public versionof the OASIS XLST conformance suite.<H4><A NAME="ModuleXMLQuery"></A>XMLQuery</H4><P>The XMLQuery module implements access to document models based on XML Query expressions.These incorporate XML Path expressions to address document elements and extend themwith construction operations. The module includes an implementation for the XML Querylibrary, an interpreter for queries formulated as S-expressions and, a parser totranslate string-encoded expressions into the equivalent S-expression form.</P><H5>Conformance</H5><P>The query parser manages all of the examples in the query use cases. In some cases,the parse is ambiguous. The code generator is at an early stage.</P><P>A serializer is included. It is restricted to data model instances and followsthe concrete syntax for the query algebra, not the query language.<H4><A NAME="ModuleXMLQueryDataModel"></A>XMLQueryDataModel</H4><P>The instance model represents an <A HREF="#XMLInfoset">Infoset</A> compatibledocument model. The root class for the abstract model is ABSTRACT-NODE, of whichthe specializations DOC-NODE, ELEM-NODE, ATTR-NODE, NS-NODE, PI-NODE, and COMMENT-NODEconstitute the principal concrete specializations. The root of a result documentinstance is a DOC-NODE, which binds a single ELEM-NODE and a (COMMENT-NODE + ELEMENT-NODE+ PI-NODE) set. Within the element node, content is represented with a sequence ofstrings and/or ELEM-NODE instances, Element attributes appear as a sequenceof ATTR-NODEinstances and namespaces appear as a sequence of NS-NODE instances. Where a documenttype definitions is present, each instance binds its respective definition instanceto its DEF slot.</P><P>A DOC-NODE collects definitions for DEF-GENERAL-ENTITY, DEF-PARAMETER-ENTITY,DEF-NOTATION, and DEF-TYPE. The bindings can be effected upon instantiation or incrementally- as is the case when parsing. A slot is available to cache attribute declarations,but it is entirely informational. The effective declarations are those in the respectiveDEF-TYPE instance. The XML parser collectes them there when processing a DTD.</P><P>A DOC-NODE also collects ID attribute instances as they occur in a hashtable whichmaps ID values to the respective ELEM-NODE instance.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD><HR>		</TD>		<TD WIDTH="24" UNITS="PIXELS">[<A HREF="#TOP">Top</A>]</TD>	</TR></TABLE><H3><A NAME="Installation"></A>Installation</H3><P>The source archives should unpack to a single <A HREF="release-directories.gif"target="Directories">directory</A> with the files &quot;sysdcl.lisp&quot; and &quot;define-system.lisp&quot;andthe directory &quot;code&quot; at the top level.

A		version compiled with CL-HTTP must be loaded into the equivalent run-time environment.		One might consider splitting the code, and implementating the distinctions on a functional		basis, rather than via macro-expansion. This would require replicating the necessary		aspects of the cl-http package structure.		<LI>When compiled for CL-HTTP, uri references must follow legal uri syntax and must		manifest a known scheme. In any event, file and http urls are supported for retrieval		only.		<LI>The code generator for the parsers generates a spurious clause for non-terminals		which cannot fail. Some LISP compilers emit a warning for this. Should they bother		you, the fail clauses can be editied out of the generated source files.		<LI>When parsing with reduction disabled, <EM><STRONG>no</STRONG></EM> content is		examined. This precludes interpretation of both external references and encoding		declarations. Which means that the parser does not attempt to adjust the encoding		to that which is declared in the document. In order to effect a selective parse,		the construction context mechanism which supports event generation must be used instread		of simply disabling reduction.		<LI>Text is modelled as strings. XQDM includes a text node, but the parser does not		yet permit their use. This precludes paths which use a text node's parent.		<LI>The XPath and XQuery modules are at an early stage.		<P>	</UL>	<LI>Schemas	<P>Support for XML Schemas is planned.

It specifies an encoding for document type definitions	only. The <A HREF="#W3C.XMLNames">XML-Names</A> recommendation goes a step further,	where it specifies aspects of a sematics and encoding for universal names.	<LI><A NAME="XMLConform"></A> The OASIS conformance suite, in the version 20010315	was used for confrmance testing.	<LI><A NAME="W3C.XHTML"></A> (XHTML): The <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1">recommendation</A>	is available from the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/">w3</A> consortion.	<LI><A NAME="W3C.XML"></A> (XML): The <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml">XML	standard</A> specifies the code used to serialize data models as well as the groundrules	for document and processor conformance. It also specifies validation criteria, but	is restricted to namespace-neutral encodings.	<LI><A NAME="W3C.XMLDOM"></A> (XMLDOM): The <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/DOM/">XML	DOM</A> specifies the terms of a &quot;a generic tree-based API for XML&quot;. It	offers &quot;a platform- and language-neutral interface that will allow programs	and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of	documents&quot;. The W3C-endorsed DOM specification - even the most limited, &quot;level-1&quot;	standard, entails numerous features which are redundant for a lisp-based implementation.	For this reason, the <A HREF="#W3C.XQDM">XML Query Data Model</A> was used instead	as the abstract basis for the document model implementation.	<LI><A NAME="W3C.XMLINFO"></A> (XMLINFO): The <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset">XML	Infoset</A> specifies the terms of an abstract model for the content of a document.	This model, in the concrete form of the <A HREF="#W3C.XQDM">XML Query Data Model</A>,	serves as the input for XML Query and XML Path operations.	<LI><A NAME="W3C.XMLNames"></A> (XMLNAMES): The provisions for encoding articulate	names in XML describes how to treat the document entity.

The former describes	the abstract semantics of query operations against a data model.
