<H3><A NAME="XML-BACKGROUND"></A>A bit of background on XML</H3>
<P>There is a wealth of information available on-line about XML One might start with
one of the following:

<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="http://www.w3.org/XML/">the W3 xml page</A>,
	<LI>an <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/why/xmlapps.htm">article
	by Jon Bosak</A>, which suggests various xml applications,

</UL>

<P>XML is a <A HREF="#language">notation</A> for storing, retrieving, and, in general,
communicating data in a &quot;self-describing&quot; serialized form. It is a syntax
to &quot;mark up&quot; text-encoded data. The encoding uses annotated, or attributed
tags to denote sequence and containment relations among data. Each application is
free to define its own tags and relations as a document type. XML is proposed, in
particular, as a notation for data to be exchanged between HTTP clients and servers
(or, more accurately among any processes capable of operating with URL-specified
data resources). To quote the original standard


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>&quot;The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple dialect of SGML.... The
	goal is to enable generic SGML to be served, received, and processed on the Web in
	the way that is now possible with HTML. XML has been designed for ease of implementation
	and for interoperability with both SGML and HTML.&quot;

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>There is now even a form of HTML ( <A HREF="REC-XHTML">XHTML</A> ) which is a
direct implementation of XML. A definition is, however, optional and documents are
also permitted, which have no definition, so long as all elements are marked with
matching open and close tags or with an empty tag, and so long as containment relations
are unambiguous.</P>
<P>One might, for example, express the most trivial of relations from the lisp domain
as the following XML document:</P>
<PRE>&lt;cons&gt;&lt;car&gt;first&lt;/car&gt;&lt;cdr&gt;rest&lt;/cdr&gt;&lt;/cons&gt;
</PRE>
<P>The following, also trivial, HTML document, would also be a legitimate XML document:</P>
<PRE>&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;<CODE>&lt;title&gt;A Title&lt;/title&gt;</CODE>&lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;greetings in xml&lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;
</PRE>
<P>In addition to the encoded content proper, in order to remain in accord with the
various anscilliary standards, a documents likely includes a certain amount of &quot;commentary&quot;:</P>
<PRE><CODE>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html 
      PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot;
     &quot;DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;A Title&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;</CODE>greetings in xml<CODE>&lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;</CODE></PRE>
<P>One of the purposes for these additions, is to incorporate &quot;meta&quot;-data
into the document by reference. The <CODE>DOCTYPE</CODE> form, for example, specifies
the name and location of a &quot;document type definition&quot; which, in turn, describes
the forms a valid document must follow. The <CODE>xmlns</CODE> attribute, for example,
designates the &quot;namespace&quot; in which all unprefixed element names reside.</P>
<P>XML is embodied in meriad proposals from the world-wide-web consortion, the internet
engineering task force and the international standards organization. the consitiute
a vast bidy of technical notes concerning the representation, communication and manipulation
of &quot;document objects&quot;.

<UL>
	<LI>the <A HREF="#W3C.XML">XML proposal</A> itself, concerns the standard notation
	to serialize &quot;document objects&quot;.
	<LI>a <CITE>&quot;document object model&quot;</CITE> (or <A HREF="#W3C.DOM">&quot;DOM&quot;</A>)
	describes a standard class hierarchy and functional interface to retrieve data from
	&quot;document objects&quot;.
	<LI>an <CITE>&quot;extensible style language</CITE> (or <A HREF="#W3C.XSL">&quot;XSL&quot;</A>)
	proposes a system-independent description language for presentation and data store
	interfaces
	<LI>an <CITE>&quot;extensible linking language</CITE> (or <A HREF="#NOTE-XLL">&quot;</A><A
	HREF="#W3C.XLL">XLL</A><A HREF="#NOTE-XLL">&quot;</A>) concerns the representation
	on effects of links between &quot;document objects&quot;.
	<LI>the &quot;<I>simple object application protocol</I>&quot; (or &quot;<A HREF="#W3C.SOAP">SOAP</A>&quot;)
	concerns interprocess comunication.
	<LI>java classes exist (<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/standards/xml/xmlparse.htm#docs">com.ms.xml.dso</A>)
	which can operate within a brower to retrieve content from xml data sources and incorporate
	them in html content.
</UL>

<P>In terms useful for the LISP developer, this means that an XML-serialization interface
suffices to communicate data with any and all of

<UL>
	<LI>another lisp process, which can parse xml;
	<LI>a browser, which uses xml-data sources to present the content as html
	<LI>a java process, which can parse xml;
	<LI>a sgml (or ultimately xml) editor, which could perform structurally constrained
	editing and return the data as an xml object;
	<LI>any xml-equiped database could be a persistent object store;

<H3><A NAME="OTHER-REPRESENTATIONS"></A>what about other &quot;representations&quot;</H3>
<P>the lisp world is at no loss for alternatives to serialize data or otherwise represent
it external to a lisp process. the lisp standard includes at least two means (reader
macros and load forms) which can be used to serialize data for archival or to pass
it to another process. with suitable meta-object support, the necessary definitions
can be specified as an aspect of class definition.</P>
<P>the lisp application community has also been at no loss to develop representations
for data and for data manipulation. in most cases (for example, KIF) the standard
incorporates the standard lisp reader and thereby depends on equivalent runtime support
among a communicating processes. such standards also extend well beyond the scope
of xml, to specify protocols for application-level data-exchange and to specify mechanisms
for interpreting messages.</P>

<P>xml, on the other hand, is strictly a convention for encoding. it plays a role
analogous to the <CODE>#(<I>structure-type</I> <I>slot-name</I> <I>slot-value</I>)</CODE>,
and could be substituted for it in applications which share data with foreign application
environments. as an encoding, xml does not concern protocol questions, which, in
the case of a presentation protocol, are relegated to the application domain, and
in the case of transport protocols are left to an underlying transport layer. for
the latter, http is the likely dominant protocol.for the former, remember &quot;it's
not a language, it's an encoding&quot;: semantic issues are also left entirely to
the application, whereby a number of &quot;standardized&quot; applications are being
discussed. (see the various <A HREF="http://www.w3c.org/">w3c</A> <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Submission/">submissions</A>
